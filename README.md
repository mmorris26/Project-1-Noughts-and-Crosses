# Project-1-Noughts-and-Crosses

# Motivation
The aim of this project is to practice the skills I learnt in the first 2 weeks of the SEI course. I was asked to build a game of tic-tac-toe against a set of user stories that consituted an MVP product. The game was to be built in HTML, CSS and Javascript using the concepts we had been taught in the first two weeks.


## User Stories

Below are the MVP user stories for this project;

* As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
* As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
* As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
* As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
* As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
* As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
* As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

### Bonus Features

Once these user stories were completed, I attempted to include the following bonus features into my game;

• Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
• Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
• Use localStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
• Involve Audio in your game
• Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you
• Make your site fully responsive so that it is playable from a mobile phone
• Get inventive with your styling e.g. use hover effects or animations

# Design Process

# My overall design process was split into 3 main stages;
• Conceptualising
• Building
• Refining
